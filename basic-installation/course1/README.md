# AMS Dispatcher Course 1 - Requirements

We want to take time in this first document to setup your workstation.

Create an account on [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com/signup) you'll need it for pulling down public docker images.

Use your favorite installation to get Docker running on your machine.

Here are some references for different installation types and you can skip to that section based on which option you choose.  Remember only pick one to install

# Option 1 - Docker Desktop (easiest but only free for personal use)

Get the installation media from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

Run through the standard installation wizard and login to the client with your docker account.

# Option 2 - Podman

Get the installation instructions [here](https://podman.io/docs/installation)

One you've gotten the install completed start up podman:

```
podman machine init
podman machine start
```

Login to Docker Hub:

```
podman login docker.io
```
