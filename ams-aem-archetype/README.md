# Getting started with the AMS AEM Archetype dispatcher configuration

When you're starting a new AEM project or picking up on an existing project it's likely have started based on the [AEM Archetype](https://github.com/adobe/aem-project-archetype)

This is a boilerplate starting place when developing for AEM.  Inside the archetype is a set of baseline configuration files for the Dispatcher.  In these courses you'll learn how we'll take these configuration files and work with them properly to avoid issues with Cloud Manager or on any deployment you have a Dispatcher server to deal with.
