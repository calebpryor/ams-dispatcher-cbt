# Adobe Managed Services guide to better Dispatcher filters

The Dispatcher has many hats that it wears to assist AEM in being more secure and performant.  One of the features we are goint to focus on is the ability it has to filter out traffic like a club bouncer that only allows in traffic you defined in it's filter rules.  Important note: Dispatcher filters aren't a replacement for a proper Web Application Firewall.  When implementing these filter rules we are going to consider it like a fence around your property to keep people and animals from entering your yard.  It's good enough for the general use of only letting in welcome guests but it's not like hiring a trained guard.  It's additional security not all the security for AEM.
